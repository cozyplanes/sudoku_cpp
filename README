Sudoku_CPP is a console based Sudoku game I wrote in 2008 after taking CS161, it doesn't use ncurses 
or something sophisticated, it just clears the screen and prints the current state of the program. 
It's iostream based.

I'll have to learn ncurses before I can make this better, for now, you can pretend it's 1985.

Goals:
  Implement a front-end, using ncurses or something not console based.
  Make more Object Oriented
  Make functional version (just for fun)
